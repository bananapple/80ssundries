The source code of my illustration portfolio website.

## Enviroment
* Ruby

## Dependecy
* Jekyll

## Develop
* Run loacol host by use `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Deployment ... manually ðŸ¤²
I seperated Jekyll source code and built static files.

1. Use jekyll's method `jekyll build` to generate static files
1. Copy the folder and paste to the static file repository (not this one)
1. Because it is using GitHub to host, so just `git push` the code, and done

## Misc
* I use Homebrew to install Ruby
